# FakeBSoD
The best fake BSoD program out there! Comes as an easy-to-run exe.

Upon executing, the program waits for a few seconds for the most realistic effect, then the BSoD screens appear. The mouse is also disabled during the program's running. The hotkeys are CTRL+Q, CTRL+W, and CTRL+E if you want to exit the program. After 29 seconds (the amount of time for it to cycle through all screens, it will restart the computer for an ecen more worrying effect. Although I can promise to you that this program is not malware, as shown in the source code, your antivirus may flag this executable. 

While this script in itself cannot cause any harm, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA LOSS, IRRESPONSIBLE USE OF, OR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS SOFTWARE.

Have fun, and happy pranking!
